# Sentiment-analysis

pip install nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt')

So i have two files and both are based on sentiments-anlysis based on the conversation between the recovery agent (RA) and the borrower (B).
apply first nltk in analysis.py or then apply transformers model in using_transformers.py file and make results.
